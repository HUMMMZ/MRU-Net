# MRU-Net
MRU-Net：Multi-branch expanded residual U-Net framework for thyroid ultrasound nodule image segmentation.

The proposed network framework is built on Pytorch 1.10.0 and CUDA 11.3 for Windows, and the model is trained on an NVIDIA TITAN X GPU with 12 GB of memory. The model optimizer is chosen from Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), the initial learning rate is set to 0.001, the number of iterations is 200, the input image size is 512×512, and the Batch size is set to 4.
